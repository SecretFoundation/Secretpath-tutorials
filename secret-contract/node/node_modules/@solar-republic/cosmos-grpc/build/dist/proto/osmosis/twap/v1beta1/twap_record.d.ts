 * @param sg_height - `height`: this record corresponds to, for debugging purposes
 * @param xt_time - `time`: This field should only exist until we have a global registry in the state machine, mapping prior block heights within {TIME RANGE} to times.
 * @param s_p0_last_spot_price - `p0_last_spot_price`: We store the last spot prices in the struct, so that we can interpolate accumulator values for times between when accumulator records are stored.
